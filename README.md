Politician API tests using jest and supertes

There is no authentication to these apis, I would recommend it.

after you create it, it should be at the top (or still be in order)

used jest-expect-message to create custom error messages
used lodash.omit to remove properties from object without mutating it

i didn't make any assumptions, only tested the api exactly to the specification

more to do: check POSTs for different entry types
organise tests into different test files

only assumption 400 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400

all test failures are bugs or areas where the specification does not match implementation
